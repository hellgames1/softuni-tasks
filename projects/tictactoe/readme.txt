Tic-Tac-Toe against a bot

Basically you can play Tic-Tac-Toe against a decently working bot. It tries to think one move ahead. It has three types of moves

random - when it doesn't matter where it will put an O
offensive - when it realizes it can win the next round if it puts an O somewhere
defensive - when it realizes you might win the next round if it doesn't put an O somewhere

There is a 10% chance it won't realize those things (in order to make it more human-like)

The .exe file is just the python code packaged with the necessary libraries so anyone can run it

The .en.py file is an English version of the program, since the original is in Bulgarian. The comments have also been translated.
