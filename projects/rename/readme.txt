Batch rename program

Basically it scans the folder that it's in, then allows you to rename each file by replacing certain strings, or inserting text either at the beginning or end of the name of each file. You can do more advanced renaming by combining a few of these actions.

The .exe file is just the python code packaged with the necessary libraries so anyone can run it. Keep in mind the exe file NEEDS to be named rename.exe and nothing else for the program to work, while the python file can be named anything. Of course, the program doesn't attempt to rename itself.

The .en.py file is an English version of the program, since the original is in Bulgarian.
