Very simple (and easily hackable) chat program

The client side is the Python code, the server side is the PHP code.
For the PHP to function, it needs an empty chat.txt file and a users.txt file containing the symbols @@

The .exe file is just the python code packaged with the necessary libraries so anyone can run it (if my server, which is hardcoded, is still online)
